# PythonHelpers

These helper methods were implemented by me after one week of learning programming. I am aware of existing solutions like Numpy, but I decided to understand some of underlying mechanics in-depth, before using ready modules. I tried to make the code as concise as possible while maintaining readability.

I've used multiple learning materials, but mainly the following course: https://eu.udacity.com/course/introduction-to-python--ud1110
